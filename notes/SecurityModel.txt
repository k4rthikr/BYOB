* We want a new model to authenticate the customer, propose that to infosec
	* Will this really optimize AHT ?
	Authentication takes time usually for email address and accents are the concerns. ASR might not help with that.

IVR Apps:
-- WMS

-- PRIME CANCEL 
	- You need only last 4 of CC and expiry
-- RETURNS 

-- DNR

Come up with different auth models for these use cases, get them approved by infosec.
