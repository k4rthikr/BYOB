Length of audio file (~20s) not an issue.
What is the overall quantity of audio required?
    * 1000hours? Thats too high for DPT.

Summary : We can't give CSA's access to the tool as the tool gives access to many things

* To start with, atleast 20hours of data to go into beta

Type of Transcribing
* Not as complex as Echo, but maybe similar to mShop or Fire TV?

* libcurl to interact with BlueFront

Security:
* Discuss with Speech Platform and perhaps Infosec about security
