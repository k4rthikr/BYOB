* V2T
    * More details, is it launched, are there clients, whether we can use it, timelines ? In particular the on-premise solution. 
    * Would it work well with telephone audio? Is Recognizer the only product that would work well with IVR audio or will others work well as well?
    * How different would it be from Recognizer? Does it use MRCP or an audio stream to receive the voice?
    * Are language packs available in them as well? Does pricing change based off that?
    * What do you mean by servers? Will we need to buy hardware from Nuance for that?
        A: Clarified that this is just software. 
    * Can we try an evaluation copy?
    
* Conversational IVR [is a Marketing Term]
        * Is it Recognizer + an NLU module together? 
        * If we have our own NLU module, how can we use Recognizer to get something similar?
        * What is the return data? Does it return an intent? 

    * How much of this is pluggable? Is it coupled with the Nuance IVR Voice platform or is it an independent piece which we can integrate with our systems?
    * Evaluation license for that

* Our Areas of Interest 
    * Use cases like Address, Email Address
        * Address Model - details?
        * Email Address in general is difficult, but if we ask the user to spell out the email address, will it be easier?
        * Live Agent ? 

Notes:
* Office in Seattle - Will it be possible for me to meet someone in person there to clarify my doubts? 
* NLU - Does not use Open ended dialogue (unconstrained phrases), it uses keywords and word placements (associations) from the audio directly
* Nuance Dialgoues Modules
    * Has some grammars and call flows. eg: Address NDM
* Email Address is very difficult

Other Action Items:
* Product Manager for V2T, check his schedule and see if we can have a meeting with him
