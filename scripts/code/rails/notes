Installation
* Installed rails (brew)
* Installed PostGres (nrew) - not sure why I had to install this 
* rails --version # was showing that something is not installed and that I have to run:

* The above line was failing with the error that libpq was not found.
sudo env ARCHFLAGS="-arch x86_64" gem install pg -v '0.17.1'
sudo bundle update pg
* This fixed things for me
